# Style Atlas Code Challenge

## Goals:

1. Provide you, the applicant, an opportunity to show us just how skilled you are
2. Provide us, Style Atlas, an opportunity to understand how well your skillset fits into our needs

## What we look for:

1. Code legibility: Code should be simple to understand and read. Comments should be kept to a minimum, the code should explain itself.
2. Development practices: Concise commits. Use of branches.
3. Problem solving ability

Repository: https://github.com/style-atlas/graphql-pokemon
Server: https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/

### Submission:

To submit the challenge, you must send us a diff of the code you've written. Preferably as a pull request:

1. Either fork an existing repository, or create a new one...
2. Make a branch where you will perform your work...
3. Email [jobs@styleatlas.co](mailto:jobs@styleatlas.co) with a link to the diff you would like us to review

## Tools / Tips

- To kickstart any front-end development, we'd recommend using [Create React App Typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)
